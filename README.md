## Abstract

> web1: read <br> 
> web2: read / write <br> 
> web3: read / write / own <br> 

This lite paper introduces LikeButton.base, a decentralized "Like Button" built on Base. 
LikeButton.base reimagines the most important social media tool in Web2, the "like button", 
and rebuilds for the Web3 social media graph. 

## Background

> A like button, like option, or recommend button is a feature in communication software such
> as social networking services, Internet forums, news websites and blogs where the user can
> express that they like, enjoy or support certain content...This is a quantitative alternative
> to other methods of expressing reaction to content, like writing a reply text.<br>

Decentralized social media tools and social graphs represent a groundbreaking paradigm shift in
data ownership and the evolution of online interaction enabled by Web3. 

The signifigence of Like Buttons on the internet lie not only in their current prominence on every 
major tech company social media platform but also in the historical trajectory of the internet, 
the web, and society. "Likes" are the literal fuel of big tech algorithms, the drivers of internet traffic,
and the metric which shapes our modern day culture.

The rise of decentralized social media is rooted in a quest for increased autonomy, data ownership, 
and community-driven content curation, marking a departure from the centralized models that have 
long dominated the digital landscape of Web2. Against this backdrop, evolved the technologies the enable 
decentralized social media tools and social graphs.

## Past

> Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. It began with the forging of the great like button.<br>

> The like button on the social networking website Facebook was first enabled on February 9, 2009...The like button
> enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and
> advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content appears in the News Feeds of that user's friends,
> and the button also displays the number of other users who have liked the content, including a full or partial list of those users.<br>

Before Web2.0 and the social media sandboxes which have come to dominate the web and out lives, there was Web1.  

It was a simpler time, users didn't have profile pages, instead built websites on domains they owned.  The Web
wasn't cookie-cutter, it didn't employ professional designers informed by teams of PhD's with the latest research
on psyhcology aimed at getting users to spend more time using their services, clicking their buttons, creating and
posting content in exchange for little hits of dopamine with every "like" they recieve.

No users expressed themselves by creating their own websites limited only by their imaginations.  Nothing looked 
the same on the web because none of use are the same.  The Web encouraged us to be ourselves and express ourselves.
In exchange, we owned our own content, we owned the traffic our content generated, and we learned skills that gave
us agency.  Don't believe me?  Here is [Mark Zuckerburg's personal website](https://web.archive.org/web/20021104225654/http://www.angelfire.com/ny/mez51/) from 1999 courtesy of the Internet Archieve.

As the saying goes, sometimes we must take a step back to make a giant leap forward.

## Present

> One button to rule them all, One button to find them,
> One button to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.<br> 
> -Galadriel

> Social network like buttons on websites other than their own are often used as web beacons to track user activities for targeted
> advertising such as behavioral targeting combined with personally identifiable information, and may be considered a breach of
> Internet privacy...the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy and Technology, Center for Digital Democracy,
> Consumer Action, Consumer Watchdog, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Electronic Privacy Information Center, Privacy Activism, Privacy
> Lives, and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse sent an open letter to Facebook requesting that it "Do not retain data about specific visitors
> to third party sites that incorporate "social plugins" or the "like" button, unless the site visitor chooses to interact with those tools."<br>

Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology, or decentralized ledger technology, enabling for the first time the ability to 
transact trustlessly person to person without any centralized authority or servers.  Ethereum perfected blockchain technology 
with the addition of immuntable self-executing code on a decentralized blockchain, known as smart contracts. 

To date much of what has been built on Ethereum follows in Bitcoin's footsteps and emphasizes financial transactions and 
stores of value.  However, Ethereum and smart contracts are more than just decentralized finance, they are the wire clippers 
that will free from the barbed wire fencing of Web2 social media giants that own our data, control our data, and
have the power to censor us.  Information, data and speech seek to be free, and it is the ultimate aim of Likebutton.base
to set the most valuable data of Web2 free.

### Decentralized Like Button for Web3

Likebutton.base will build ðŸ’™ tokens on Base and Ethereum L2 blockchain dedicated to scaling Ethereum to the next billion users.
ðŸ’™ is like giving it a heart and soul of LikeButton.base, no pun intended. These tokens aren't just a functional part of
the project, they represent the project's core values and goals. By turning appreciation and community support into ðŸ’™, 
LikeButton.base is creating a tangible link between users and their expressions of appreciation.

Choosing the ðŸ’™ emoji for the token symbols is all about making things fun and adding a touch of individuality. Emojis are the
universal language of expression, and they bring a playful and personal vibe to the project. It's not just about making ðŸ’™ tokens
visually appealing; it's about making the act of showing appreciation more enjoyable for everyone in the community.

In simple terms, the way we turn likebutton.eth into ðŸ’™ tokens and play with emojis isn't just for show. It's about capturing the 
essence of LikeButton.base â€” the project that wants to change how we express and receive support in the decentralized social media world.
Through these thoughtful touches, LikeButton.base aims to create a special and enjoyable experience, reinforcing the bond between users
and their ability to share and receive love in the digital space.

### Decentralized Social Graph

Beyond the playful emojis, LikeButton.base introduces an innovative dimension with its connectivity feature. This functionality 
allows users to visually map the interconnected web of appreciations within the community. The very data Web2 social media
collects from us that they inturn use to sell our content and attention to their advertisers.  Imagine a dynamic network 
showcasing who sent likes to whom, creating a lively visual representation of the community's shared moments of appreciation. This 
interconnected web not only adds a layer of transparency but also enhances the sense of connection among community members by making 
visible the threads of acknowledgment and support that weave through the decentralized social fabric. The ability to see and navigate 
this intricate network fosters a deeper understanding of the community's dynamics, making the experience of giving and receiving ðŸ’™ 
on LikeButton.base even more engaging and meaningful.  ðŸ’™ holds the power to set our data free, by extension it sets us free as 
individuals to once again capture the value of our content and relationships, and sets us free collectively to shape culture.
